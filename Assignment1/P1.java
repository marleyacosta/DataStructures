/********************************************************************* 
Purpose/Description: This program checks if a number is found in a N by N matrix by starting 
at the right-most bottom  side of the matrix(lowest number) and checking if the number is within the range of the matrix.
If the number is within the range the function checks if the number is found by moving up rows and going left for columns.
