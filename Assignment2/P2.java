	 * This method returns the index of an element in a list that appears more than half the time.
	 * The time complexity of this method is O(N) because the consecutive for loops are both done in linear time.
	 * The first for loop traverses all the elements in the array and counting until the end. That is done in linear time.
	 * The second for loop traverses all the elements in the array counting if the leader number occurs more than half the time.
	 * The if statement is constant. 
	 * @param A The integer array to search the leader element in.
	 * @return returns the index of the leader element in A or -1 if the leader element is not found in A.
